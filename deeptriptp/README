DeepTrip 
Take a deep trip! Soft-survival match puzzle. Match colors! Play to relax and concentrate.

How to run:
The program needs two arguments to run:

Search Strategy method must be set in the first Argument.
Accepted Arguments:
DFS - Depth-first search.
BFS - Breadth-first search.
AStar - A* search algorithm.
IDDFS - Iterative deepening depth-first search.
Greedy - Greedy search algorithm.

Heuristic method must be set in the second Argument.
Accepted Arguments:
HOne - Selects the first Heuristic.
HTwo - Selects the second Heuristic.
HThree - Selects the third Heuristic.

Example:
AStar HThree
This runs the solver with the A* search strategy with the Heuristic number three.
